# Tutoring

This repository contains various web projects that I use to teach my students as part of tutoring sessions. These projects are designed to cover fundamental to intermediate topics in web development.

## Project Structure

Each folder is categorized by the technology or framework used, with individual project folders underneath. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the current projects:

### html-css

1. **01-portfolio**
   - A simple portfolio website template, designed to introduce HTML and CSS basics. Students learn about layout structures, styling, responsive design, and basic animations.

### react

1. **todo-app**
   - A basic to-do list application built with React. This project introduces students to component-based architecture, state management, and handling user interactions in React. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks.
